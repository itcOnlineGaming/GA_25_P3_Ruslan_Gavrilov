### **How To Use the UI Menu System**

This guide outlines the steps to integrate the UI Menu system into your Tower Defence Game. Follow these instructions to set up and manage your menus, animations, and scene transitions.

#### **Step 1: Set Up Core Game Objects**

1. **Create a new game object** in your scene.  
2. **Attach the following scripts** to the newly created game object:  
   * **UIGeneralController**: This singleton handles enabling/disabling UI elements, managing animations, and loading scenes asynchronously.  
   * **UniversalSettings**: This script is responsible for saving the volume setting from the volume slider.  
3. **Do not destroy** these game objects when loading a new scene to maintain access to these scripts.

#### **Step 2: Create the Canvas and Add UI Elements**

1. **Create a canvas** in your scene.  
2. **Drag any desired UI elements** from the provided prefabs onto the canvas.

#### **Step 3: Manage UI Elements Through Script**

1. **Create a new script** in your project, name it appropriately (e.g., `MenuManager`).  
2. This script will be responsible for turning UI elements on/off and transitioning between menus.

#### **Step 4: Store UI Elements**

In your newly created script, declare variables to store references to the CanvasGroups for your UI menus:

| // CanvasGroups for the UI menuspublic CanvasGroup FullMenu;public CanvasGroup TowersMenu;public CanvasGroup DetailsView;public CanvasGroup Settings;public CanvasGroup WinScreen;public CanvasGroup LoseScreen; |
| :---- |

These variables will represent the UI menus and their visibility states.

#### **Step 5: Enable/Disable UI Elements**

Use the following functions to control the visibility of your UI elements:

* **Disable a UI group:**

| CanvasGroupController.DisableGroup({canvasGroup}); |
| :---- |

* **Enable a UI group:**

| CanvasGroupController.EnableGroup({canvasGroup}); |
| :---- |

#### **Step 6: Play Animations**

Use the **UIGeneralController** to play animations when transitioning between menus:

* **Toggle UI (Play Opening Animation):**

| UIGeneralController.ToggleUI({canvasGroup}); |
| :---- |

* **Close UI (Play Closing Animation):**

| UIGeneralController.CloseUI({canvasGroup}); |
| :---- |

#### **Step 7: Open and Close Menus**

For clarity, create separate functions to open and close each menu. For example, the following function opens the Details Menu:

| public void OpenDetailsMenu(){    // Disable the button used to open the details menu    CanvasGroupController.DisableGroup(TowersMenuButton);    // Enable the DetailsView menu and make it visible    CanvasGroupController.EnableGroup(DetailsMenu);    // Play opening animation for the FullMenu    UIGeneralController.ToggleUI(FullMenu);    // Track which menu is currently active    menuStage \= MenuStage.DetailsView;} |
| :---- |

To **close a menu**, use an asynchronous function to wait for the closing animation to finish before re-enabling any other elements. Example:

| public async void BackButton(){    // Wait for the closing animation to finish    await UIGeneralController.CloseUI(menuDictionary\[MenuStage.SettingsView\]);    // Re-enable the buttons for opening menus    CanvasGroupController.EnableGroup(SettingsButton);    CanvasGroupController.EnableGroup(TowersMenuButton);    // Update the enum to track the current screen    menuStage \= MenuStage.GamePlay;} |
| :---- |

#### **Step 8: Load a Scene**

To load a scene while displaying a loading screen, use the following method. First, make sure you have a **loading screen prefab** to mask the scene transition.

| public void ReturnHome(){    // Display loading screen while loading the scene    UIGeneralController.LoadScene(LoadingScreen, "Menu");} |
| :---- |

**Note:** Replace `"Menu"` with the name of the scene you want to load. Attach this function to a button, and the scene will load when clicked.

**Notes:**

You are free to create your own UI menus based on what suits you games, you can add UI elements to the menus that already exist, example: Tooltips on the loading screen. These wonâ€™t override the prefab but add onto it inside of the scene you are using. 

By following these steps, you will be able to set up a fully functional UI menu system, handle animations, and manage scene transitions effectively.
